# Blind Control
Need more natural lighting? Forgot to close your blinds before leaving home and worried about wandering eyes peeking at your valuables? Save energy for heating naturally using Blind Control. Fourty eight percent of sunlight is absorbed by the surface and converted to heat. Instead of using this natural source of heating, many people keep their blinds closed.

How does it work? <insert hardware info>

Blind Control has a multitude of use cases:

Blind Control maximizes your wellbeing at home by ensuring that there is adequate natural indoor lighting. Natural light increases vitamin D, a critical nutrient that prevents bone loss, heart disease, weight gain, and various cancers. Increasing indoor lighting can also ward off depression and improve sleep.

Blind Control's mobile app gives users the ability to close and open their blinds from their phone when they are away from home.

Using Google Cloud Functions, the mobile app can update the desired state of the blinds (open or closed) in the cloud. Separate scripts can be run locally to get the desired state and communicate with the Arduino directly. 

Blind Control also promotes home security by giving you remote access control to close and open your blinds when you are away from home. Closing the blinds and curtains are common home security measures to reduce the chances of a home invasion. 

Fun Fact: Sunlight produces 0.0079W/m^2 per lux (photon flux). One open window equates to half a heater! Imagine the savings!
